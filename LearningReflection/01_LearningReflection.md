> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- I actually quite enjoyed the experience, i was somehow expecting it to be more difficult, before I started working on it, but it turned out to be quite a fun excercise.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I created the test cases based on the different functionalities i observed on the webpage, after taking a look at it. I started off by thinking about what the function was doing and then designing the steps for testing this functionality.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     I believe our approach here was fine, but some alternative methods worth considering, include utilizing spreadsheets, word documents, or employing specialized applications tailored for this purpose.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio Code


## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not run into any issues


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used github before many times during my current and previous studies.
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I might think Selenium could be quite fun to learn and use, for its maturity, and programming language support, but for these test cases it would probably be easier, and better to use Robot framework since it should be quite beginner friendly.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- here are some of the skills and competencies that I found while looking through job posting on LinkedIn:
    - experience with automated continuous integration
    - Selenium
    - Robot Framework
    - Python
    - Jenkins 
    - Git
    - Familiarity with API and database testing


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I suppose I would need to study more about test automation skills/frameworks.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think the project did help me but the theoretical knowledge in to perspective a bit more, since i had to actually design some test cases, as well as to write a bug report. As for the course, I thought it was quite enjoyable, but perhaps i would place some more actual returnable assignments (labs?) where we could practice these skills through out the course.
